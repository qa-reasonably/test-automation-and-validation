# API Testing with Postman

This section demonstrates API testing skills using Postman against a public REST API.

## Covered Scenarios
- Health checks
- CRUD operations on users
- Positive and negative test cases
- Status code and schema validation
- Authentication and authorization behavior

## Tools Used
- Postman
- JavaScript assertions
- Environment variables

## Notes
- All requests were validated both via Postman and browser network inspection using Chrome DevTools.
- Screenshots demonstrate collection structure, environment configuration, positive and negative API scenarios, authentication flows, and end-to-end execution via Collection Runner.
- ReqRes was selected to demonstrate realistic REST behaviors (CRUD, auth validation, error handling) without proprietary data.
